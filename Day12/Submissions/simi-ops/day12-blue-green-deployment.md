## Personal Information

- **GitHub Username:** simi-ops

## Task Completion
- [x] Read Chapter 5 (Pages 169-189) - "Zero-Downtime Deployment Techniques"
- [x] Completed Lab 13: Module Composition
- [x] Completed Lab 14: Module Versioning
- [x] Implemented zero-downtime deployment strategy with Terraform (Blue/Green deployment)

## Infrastructure Details

### Blue/Green Deployment Strategy
I've implemented a blue/green deployment strategy using Terraform to ensure zero-downtime during application updates. The key features include:

1. **Dual Environment Architecture**
   - Separate blue and green environments with identical infrastructure
   - Independent Auto Scaling Groups for each environment
   - Shared Application Load Balancer with weighted routing

2. **Traffic Management**
   - Configurable traffic distribution between environments
   - Gradual traffic shifting capability (0% to 100%)
   - Immediate rollback capability if issues are detected

3. **Deployment Automation**
   - Deployment script for managing the entire process
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Version tracking through SSM Parameters

4. **Monitoring and Health Checks**
   - Health checks for both environments
   - CloudWatch alarms for performance and availability
   - Automated detection of unhealthy hosts

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Complete Separation**: Blue and green environments are completely separate, allowing independent updates.

2. **Gradual Transition**: Traffic can be shifted gradually from one environment to another, allowing for canary testing.

3. **Rollback Capability**: If issues are detected, traffic can be immediately shifted back to the stable environment.

4. **Environment Awareness**: Configuration adapts based on the deployment environment (dev, staging, production).

5. **Stateless Design**: The application is designed to be stateless, with any state stored externally.

## Zero-Downtime Process

The zero-downtime deployment process works as follows:

1. **Initial State**: All traffic goes to the active environment (e.g., blue).

2. **Prepare New Environment**: Deploy the new application version to the inactive environment (e.g., green).

3. **Test New Environment**: Verify the new environment is functioning correctly.

4. **Gradual Traffic Shift**: Gradually shift traffic from blue to green (e.g., 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).

5. **Complete Transition**: Once all traffic is on the new environment, make it the active environment.

6. **Cleanup**: The old environment becomes the new inactive environment for future updates.

## Key Learnings

Implementing this zero-downtime deployment strategy taught me several important lessons:

1. **Infrastructure as Code Maturity**: Using Terraform modules and parameterization creates a flexible, reusable deployment system.

2. **Testing is Critical**: The ability to test the new environment before shifting traffic is essential for reliability.

3. **Monitoring Integration**: Integrating monitoring and health checks into the deployment process helps catch issues early.

4. **Rollback Planning**: Always plan for failure by implementing easy rollback mechanisms.

5. **Stateless Design**: Applications must be designed with zero-downtime deployments in mind, particularly regarding state management.
